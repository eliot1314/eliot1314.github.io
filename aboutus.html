          <h3>2019</h3>
          <p>Began as a small initiative to address the growing need for data literacy and cybersecurity in the
            nonprofit sector. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we gained valuable experience by helping NGOs adapt to the
            challenges of remote operations and increased digital reliance.</p>

          <p>We collaborated with leading firms like PwC and KPMG to support NGOs in assessing and fostering Hong Kong's
            post-pandemic economic recovery. This partnership allowed us to establish a reputation for delivering
            impactful, data-driven insights. By 2024, we expanded our services to include online courses, equipping NGOs
            with the tools to navigate cybersecurity threats and comply with privacy laws globally.</p>
