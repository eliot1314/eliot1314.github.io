          <h3>Definitions</h3>
          <p><strong>Prescribed Consent:</strong> Prescribed consent refers to the express consent given by a data
            subject for the intended use or provision of their personal data. This consent must be specific to the class
            of persons and the kind of personal data as specified in the information provided to the data subject. Thus,
            the consent given is specific to the data provider in this scenario.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Express Consent:</strong> Express consent refers to the clear, voluntary, and unequivocal agreement
            given by a person for the use or provision of their personal data. This type of consent is explicitly
            provided, rather than implied, and is necessary for certain data-processing activities.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="examples">
          <h3>Examples</h3>
          <p><strong>Prescribed Consent Example:</strong> When a patient visits a hospital, they are often required to
            sign a consent form that allows the hospital to collect and use their personal health information for
            treatment purposes. This consent is specific to the healthcare providers involved and the type of data being
            collected, such as medical history and current health status.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Express Consent Example:</strong> When a user signs up for a social media platform, they are often
            required to agree to the platform's terms of service and privacy policy by checking a box or clicking "I
            agree." This action constitutes express consent, as the user is explicitly agreeing to the collection and
            use of their personal data as outlined in the terms and privacy policy. Unlike prescribed consent, which is
            specific to certain classes of persons and types of data, express consent in this context is a general
            agreement to the platform's data practices

            An NGO that initially collected personal data from volunteers to coordinate event participation. Later, the
            NGO decides to use this data to send out invitations for a new training program. Since this is a different
            use than originally intended, the NGO must obtain new consent from the volunteers to use their data for this
            purpose. This ensures that the volunteers are aware of and agree to their data being used in a new way.
